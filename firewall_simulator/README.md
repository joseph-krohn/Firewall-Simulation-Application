# Firewall/IDS/IPS Simulator

This is a Python-based simulator for a simple firewall, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). It allows you to simulate basic packet filtering, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention using customizable rules and signatures.

## Features

- **Firewall**: Define rules to allow or block packets based on IP addresses.
- **IDS**: Detect intrusions based on predefined signatures in packet payloads.
- **IPS**: Prevent intrusions by taking action on packets with matching signatures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
